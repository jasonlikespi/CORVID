Rework CORVID_SCREEN in CORVID_WORLD
MiniScreen


Now

Create methods to allow for selection, deletion, and modification of objects in the ingame UI
Add textures that can be used to create larger and arbitrarily sized rectangles
Add the player Sprite
Add physics
Fix the templates; probably make it so all screenobjects use float templates
What I was doing: Reconfiguring the Texture Class to use a single static texture list
