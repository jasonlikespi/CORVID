Rework CORVID_SCREEN in CORVID_WORLD
MiniScreen
Next Step is to load save files


Now
Create and simplify default constructor for CORVID_SCREEN and CORVID_WORLD
Create methods to allow for selection, deletion, and modification of objects in the ingame UI
What I was doing: Fix the constructor method for the CORVID_SCREENOBJECT class that is used for the screen rendering the title screen to give it a nonempty texture
